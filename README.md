# Google Maps Clone using the Mapbox GL JS

What I'm experimenting with:

• Mapbox GL JS - A JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps from vector tiles and Mapbox styles

• Directions API - turn-by-turn instructions using four different Mapbox routing profiles: mapbox/driving-traffic, mapbox/driving, mapbox/walking, and mapbox/cycling

This was a fun deep dive into using Mapbox and its Directions API.
